## UI Components
- Always use shadcn-ui components for UI elements
- Import UI components from the `src/components/ui/` directory
- Prefer shadcn-ui components over custom implementations for common UI patterns like buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc.
- When creating new UI components, follow shadcn-ui patterns and conventions
- Ensure all UI components are responsive and accessible
- Maintain consistency in styling and theming across the application
